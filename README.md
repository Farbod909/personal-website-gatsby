# Simple Blog

This is a very _very_ basic Gatbsy website that just takes all Markdown files from the folder `blog_posts/` and creates HTML pages from them.

## Try it out

First, make sure you have Gatsby.

```bash
$ npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Then,

```bash
$ npm install
$ gatsby develop
```

Then navigate to `localhost:8000`.
