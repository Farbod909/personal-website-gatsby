This is most relevant of course as we are approaching another presidential election.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>A large number of issues that most Americans care about revolve around money: taxation, healthcare, welfare, free college, etc. and there are a lot of politicians who seriously discuss these topics as part of their campaigns. However, whenever these candidates attempt to explain how to fund these initiatives, the supportive arguments are very vague and the means of funding them are often dismissed as obvious. Let's look at Universal Basic Income (UBI) as an example.</p>\n<h3>Case Study: UBI</h3>\n<p>The concept of Universal Basic Income has been around for a long time, even Martin Luther King Jr. referenced it as a solution to end poverty. However, as someone who is attempting to learn more about the arguments for and against Universal Basic Income, I find myself completely lost. A simple search of \"arguments for and against UBI\" on Google results in multiple articles with the same name. The main takeaway is that cutting all other welfare programs will provide enough funding for a flat $1,000 per month per person in the United States.</p>\n<p>None of these articles provided any research on the cost of current welfare programs for the U.S. government, let alone something as simple as calculating the cost of UBI for the adult population of the United States.</p>\n<p>It's so easy that I'm willing to do it right here:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$1,000 * 12 months * 235,000,000 people in the U.S. over age 18\n= $2,820,000,000,000 per year</code></pre></div>\n<p>That's almost 3 trillion dollars per year.</p>\n<p>The next step would be to do some research on America's current welfare spending on a yearly basis, calculate an educated estimate on that and conclude if cutting all welffare spending would be a reasonable way to pay for UBI.</p>\n<p>Of course I know I'm taking a very simplistic approach to it, but <strong>anything</strong> is better than just providing absolutely no numbers and doing purely qualititative analysis on a subject that is by nature quantitative: money.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Numbers in Politics","date":"December 10, 2019"},"excerpt":"I'm a moderately informed American, but I do want to learn more about the problems our country faces and the steps that differentâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"numbers-in-politics"}}}
